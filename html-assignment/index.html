    <h1><abbr title="a really cool person">James Slone</abbr></h1>

    <p> Hello! My name is James Slone I've <strong>Always</strong> loved working with computers and I am very excited in
        taking the IMD program. For the past 2 years I have working with programs like photoshop, video editing, blender
        and have enjoyed creating with them!
    </p>

    <p>
        As of 2 months ago I have started working as a video editor for 3 different clients and I wanted to take this
        program to not only improve my curent skill but also met people and learn together because I think that's the
        best way to learn! I have built up a portfolio of 13 different videos which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQO0W1-8FGSiIMFNVgnU3GkEutDEbzJlr">here</a> if your intested.
