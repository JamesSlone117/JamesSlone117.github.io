<p> Hello! My name is James Slone I've <strong>Always</strong> loved working with computers and I am very excited in taking the IMD program. For the past 2 years I have working with programs like photoshop, video editing, blender and have enjoyed creating with them! 
</p>

<p>
    As of 2 months ago I have started working as a video editor for 2 different client and I wanted to take this program to not only improve my curent skill but also met people and learn together because I think that's the best way to learn!
