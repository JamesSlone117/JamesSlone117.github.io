        <p> Hello! My name is James Slone. I've <strong>Always</strong> loved working with computers and I am very excited about
            taking the IMD program. For the past 2 years I have been working with programs like Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, Blender
            and have enjoyed creating with them! This is my first time learning html <em>other than a few videos</em> but
            I'm excited to learn nonetheless.
        </p>

            <strong>Fun Fact: </strong> As of 2 months ago I have started working as a video editor for 3 different clients
            and I wanted to take this program to not only improve my current skills but also met people and learn together because 
            I think that's the best way to learn! I have built up a portfolio of 13 different videos which you can find
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQO0W1-8FGSiIMFNVgnU3GkEutDEbzJlr" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested.
