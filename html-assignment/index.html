            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is James Slone. I've <strong>Always</strong> loved working with computers and I am very
                excited about taking the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. For the past 2 years
                I have been working with programs like Photoshop,
                Davinci Resolve, Blender and have enjoyed creating with them! This is my first time learning html
                <em>other than a few videos</em> but I'm excited to learn nonetheless. Also H<sub>2</sub>0 is pretty
                cool.

            <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
            <p>
                As of 3 months ago I have started working as a video editor for 3 different
                clients and I wanted to take this program to not only improve my current skills but also met people and
                learn together because I think that's the best way to learn! I have built up a portfolio of 13 different
                videos which you can find
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQO0W1-8FGSiIMFNVgnU3GkEutDEbzJlr"
                    target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested.
